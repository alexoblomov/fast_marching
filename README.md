# fast_marching
Python code: runs Dijkstra algorithm for irregular meshes of Regular even n-gons
Regular Polygon Irregular Mesh: contains cpp code to generate the meshes
Jupyter notebook: contains a comparison of fast marching and Dijkstra for certain polygons as well as an illustration of Voronoi iterations on the meshes.
figs: contains illustrations of Dijkstra with various sources
