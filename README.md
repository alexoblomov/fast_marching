# fast_marching
Python code: runs Dijkstra algorithm for irregular meshes of Regular even n-gons. Nb. the full version (github installation) of PyMesh must be installed as certain functions are not installed with pip.

Regular Polygon Irregular Mesh directory: contains C++ code to generate the irregular triangle meshes. CGAL must be installed in order to run this code.

Jupyter notebooks: contain a comparison of fast marching and Dijkstra for certain polygons as well as an illustration of Voronoi iterations on the meshes. MeshPy, Meshzoo must be installed in order to run Mesh.ipynb.

figs directory: contains illustrations of Dijkstra with various sources
